# Create a class Dictionary that stores Students. The key is the username (e.g. "larsonam") and the value is of type Student

Implement methods for:

boolean isEmpty()
boolean containsKey(String uname)
Student get(String uname)
void put(String uname, Student student)
Use CHAINING for implementation. At first, use a hash function that takes the sum of the ASCII value of the first 3 characters of the username
